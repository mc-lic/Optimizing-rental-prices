# Optimizing-rental-prices

We assume that you own several properties that you want to rent on Airbnb. You want to set the optimal price per night to maximize your revenue while maintaining competitiveness and a high booking rate. The aim of the project is to analyze data on similar properties in your city to understand the factors influencing rental prices and identify potential pricing strategies.

We will apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Airbnb dataset from Kaggle datasets.
